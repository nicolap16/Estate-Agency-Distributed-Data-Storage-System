## Project Description

This project is a university assignment orginally assigned on the MSc Computing, Distributed and Cloud Computing module for building a distributed data storage system for an estate agency. The goal is to develop a system that allows users to access, store, and update information related to properties, including houses and apartments.

## Project Objectives

- Create a distributed data storage system using a remote object paradigm.
- Implement features to enable users to access property information.
- Develop functionality for storing and updating property data.
- Ensure data consistency and reliability in a distributed environment.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Frameworks and Libraries: Pyro5

## Project Structure
